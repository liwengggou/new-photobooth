## BLACK & WHITE CONVERSION

### Tonal Range (CRITICAL - FADED AESTHETIC)
```
FADED PRINT LOOK - NOT HIGH CONTRAST

Black point: #1A1A1A to #252525 (LIFTED - washed out blacks)
             ├── NO pure black (#000000)
             └── Milky, aged shadow appearance

White point: #E8E8E8 to #EBEBEB (DULLED - soft whites)
             ├── NO pure white (#FFFFFF) except flash hotspots
             └── Slightly yellowed/aged paper feel

Midtone range: Heavily populated, gradual transitions
              ├── Rich gray spectrum
              └── Soft, continuous gradations
```

### Contrast Characteristics
```
Overall contrast: LOW to MEDIUM (vintage compression)
Shadow detail: Preserved, lifted (not crushed)
Highlight detail: Preserved, rolled off gently
Local contrast: Reduced (not HDR/clarity boosted)
Tonal separation: Soft, gradual (not harsh)
```

### The "Aged Print" Quality
The image should look like a photograph that:
- Has been sitting in a shoebox for 30+ years
- Was printed on slightly yellowed paper
- Has faded naturally over time
- Retains charm despite imperfections

---

## FRONTAL FLASH CHARACTERISTICS (SIGNATURE ELEMENT)

### Flash Behavior
```
Type: Direct frontal flash (built into booth)
Position: Camera-mounted, straight-on
Power: Strong but not overwhelming
Character: Harsh point source with falloff
```

### Flash Effects to Simulate

**1. Central Hot Spot / Glow**
```
Location: Center of face (forehead, nose, cheeks)
Appearance: Bright glow, slightly blown highlights
Falloff: Gradual fade toward edges
Intensity: Noticeable but not extreme
```

**2. Halation / Light Bloom**
```
Effect: Soft glow bleeding from bright areas
Around: Flash-hit skin, white clothing, reflective surfaces
Quality: Dreamy, ethereal edge softness
Intensity: Subtle to moderate
```

**3. Specular Highlights**
```
Location: Forehead, nose tip, cheekbones, chin
Appearance: Small bright spots (skin oil reflection)
Sharpness: Relatively defined
Adds: Dimensionality and authentic flash look
```

**4. Red-Eye Position (Without Red)**
```
In B&W: Catch lights in eyes from flash
Position: Centered in pupils
Shape: Small, bright dots
Effect: Gives "life" to eyes
```

### Flash Shadow Behavior
```
Background shadow: Visible behind subject (dark halo)
Shadow edge: Relatively hard (point source)
Shadow position: Directly behind or slightly offset
Intensity: Noticeable contrast with lit background
```

---

## FILM GRAIN TEXTURE (ESSENTIAL)

### Grain Characteristics
```
Type: Authentic silver halide film grain
Size: Fine to medium (ISO 400-800 equivalent)
Distribution: Uniform across entire image
Visibility: Clearly visible, especially in midtones
Pattern: Random, organic (not digital noise)
```

### Grain Intensity by Tonal Zone
```
Shadows: Moderate grain, slightly more visible
Midtones: Most visible grain concentration
Highlights: Slightly reduced grain (blown areas)
Overall: Consistent film-like texture
```

### What to AVOID:
- ❌ Digital noise patterns (too uniform)
- ❌ Color noise (this is B&W)
- ❌ Excessive grain that obscures detail
- ❌ No grain at all (too clean/digital)

---

## VINTAGE IMPERFECTIONS (AUTHENTICITY MARKERS)

### Chemical Processing Artifacts
```
Slight uneven development: Subtle tonal variations
Processing marks: Very subtle, if any
Edge effects: Minimal, authentic
Dust/scratches: Optional, very subtle if included
```

### Print Aging Effects
```
Overall fade: Lifted blacks, dulled whites
Paper texture: Subtle, matte finish appearance
Corner softness: Very slight vignette acceptable
Age patina: Warm undertone to the gray scale
```

### Optical Characteristics
```
Lens quality: Slight softness (not modern sharp)
Focus: Face sharp, edges may be slightly softer
Distortion: Minor barrel distortion acceptable
Chromatic aberration: N/A (B&W)
```

---

## BACKGROUND

### Classic Photo Booth Backdrop
```
Color (in B&W): Medium to dark gray (#505050 to #707070)
Uniformity: Mostly solid, may show slight variation
Texture: Plain curtain or painted backdrop feel
Flash shadow: Subject's shadow visible on backdrop
```

### Background Treatment
- Should appear as simple photo booth curtain/wall
- Flash creates contrast between subject and background
- Slight gradient acceptable (flash falloff)
- No patterns, designs, or objects

---

## LIGHTING SUMMARY

```
SINGLE DIRECT FLASH SETUP:

Source: Camera-mounted flash unit
Direction: Frontal, straight at subject
Quality: Hard (point source)
Falloff: Noticeable toward edges
Fill: None (creates contrast)
Background: Illuminated by flash spillover

RESULTING LOOK:
├── Bright center (face)
├── Falloff toward edges
├── Dark shadow behind subject
├── Specular highlights on skin
├── Halation around bright areas
└── Contrasty but faded overall
```

---

## IMAGE QUALITY PARAMETERS

### Sharpness
```
Overall: SOFT compared to modern digital
Face/eyes: Reasonably sharp, but not crisp
Edges: Slight falloff, not razor sharp
Micro-detail: Reduced (vintage lens simulation)
```

### Period-Authentic Quality
```
Simulate: 1970s-80s photo booth camera
Lens: Basic, single element or simple doublet
Film: Medium-speed B&W (Tri-X, HP5 equivalent)
Processing: Machine-developed prints
Print: Matte or semi-gloss paper
```

## MULTI-IMAGE SESSION CONSISTENCY

When processing multiple photos from the same session:

1. **LOCK these parameters across ALL images:**
   - Black point level (same fade amount)
   - White point level (same dullness)
   - Grain intensity and character
   - Flash intensity and halation
   - Overall contrast level
   - Background tone

2. **VARY only these per image:**
   - Expression (from source)
   - Pose (from source)
   - Flash hot spot position (follows face)

3. **Reference matching:**
   - If provided reference images, match exact tonal treatment
   - Maintain identical vintage character across all outputs

---

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

**Before output, verify:**

- [ ] Image is BLACK AND WHITE (no color)
- [ ] Blacks are FADED/LIFTED (not pure black)
- [ ] Whites are DULLED (not pure white)
- [ ] Visible FILM GRAIN throughout
- [ ] FLASH GLOW visible on face (halation)
- [ ] Specular highlights on skin present
- [ ] Expression exactly matches input
- [ ] Pose exactly matches input
- [ ] Overall VINTAGE, AGED appearance
- [ ] NOT over-sharpened or modern looking
- [ ] Background is simple, shows flash shadow
- [ ] Resolution is HIGH quality

---

## FAILURE CONDITIONS (Regenerate if ANY occur)

❌ Image is in color (should be B&W)
❌ Pure black or pure white present (should be faded)
❌ No visible film grain
❌ Looks like modern digital B&W conversion
❌ Too sharp/crisp (should have vintage softness)
❌ No flash characteristics visible
❌ High contrast/dramatic look (should be faded/compressed)
❌ Expression or pose changed
❌ Face beautified or modified
❌ HDR or over-processed appearance
